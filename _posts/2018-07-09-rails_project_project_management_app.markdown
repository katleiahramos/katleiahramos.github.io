When I was a kid, I would take all our broken radios and hoard them in my room. I'd open them and look inside and admire all the wires and chips and colors. I was a curious kid that grew into an even more curious adult.
Me and rails. We didn't vibe at first. As someone who really likes to know know how something works, the magic that is Ruby on Rails had me lost.

Like a lot of things in life that seem magical, we can begin to make sense of them once we dig a little deeper. (*que song from Holes that goes "diggin oh oh oh diggin"*)

**The Project**

The project I landed on was a pretty typical Project Management app (or to do list type app). I used Ruby on Rails, working with the MVC paradigm to construct an app from the back end to the front end.

The Project Management rails app can be used to create projects with tasks that are assigned to team members.

The inspiration behind this app came from a friend who is an engineering Ph.D student. There are a variety of projects happening simultaneously within the research group, and keeping track of these tasks and priorities can get lost in the day-to-day grind. They needed a tool that broke down projects into tasks and kept track of who was responsible for each task.

**The Challenges**

1. Ideation

I knew I was going to make a Ruby on Rails app, but was unsure of what I was going to make. I was struggling between coming up with something creative/unique and something useful. In the end, I decided to utilize my resources and reach out to family and friends to ask them about things that make their work harder to try and figure out a web-app based solution.

2. Workflow

Going into my Sinatra Project I felt extremely confident about the steps I was going to take in creating my app. From wire-framing to the styling, I had a clear view of my route (heh heh). Going into Rails, there was a lore more darkness between what I was as start and finish. For me, darkness in planning can be intimidating. So what did I do? I decided to use what I knew -ask questions, and move step by step. I did some research and googled the process that people used to create a rails app. I found a ton of great resources out there that helped me get an idea of what I was going to do from start to finish. Of course, your process is going to depend on you and your project, but it's nice to have a foundation to build off of.

3. Prioritization

To build off of workflow, prioritizing what I was going to do and when was also a little confusing. There were things I knew I needed to include (authentication, validations), but I wasn't sure if I want to build them in right away or if that would complicate my workflow. What is better? Add the more complex features from the get go, or add them once you've gotten the basic functionality of your app working?

I decided to add them near the end. Again, I feel that the 'right' order depends on you and your project.

**The takeaways**
What did I learn from this project and this process?

Building my first ruby on rails app really reinforced some ideas I've been thinking about during all my projects.
A friend once tweeted, "**I'm not sure if I made the right decision, but at least I made one**".

Rails can feel like a lot. There are so many possibilities and pieces of the puzzle. It can be hard to decided what goes where and what part to attack first. Sometimes I get bogged down by the possibilities of what could be - and rails has the magic to make those possibilities happen- but what I found is that it's ok to move step by step, and cross those bridges when you get there.our blog post goes here.
