I've become much faster at debugging because of one simple command in the CLI:

```
Learn --fail-fast 
```


Running this in the learn IDE runs tests to the first error it encounters, and stops there. 

Why is this useful? 

You don't have to scroll through multiple error messages to find the specific one you're looking for (which, if you code the way I do, happens often when doing labs). 

Many of the labs even state that they are test driven, and therefore you actually *have to* use the tests to determine what your code must do. 

Using --fail-fast helps you piece through those tests, one by one, which is helpful to not only your problem solving process, but also your confidence. 

I've gotten really good at problem sovling (which is  *debugging* is to me) by failing, and failing often. I actually usually create my code based on my error messages.  At first I felt really bad about this, because I felt like I wasn't coding the """right""" way. I realized that forcing myself into what the """right""" way is actually keeps me from moving forward. It's ok to fail, and infact often times you need to do things !(rightWay) - NOT the right way - in order to figure out what the *best* way to do something is for YOU.
