Part 2 to my previous [blog post](http://katleiahcodes.com/scraping_whats_not_there_poltergiest_and_phantom_js).


It took me about three weeks to finish my CLI app. Don't let that scare you! I was out of the country for a week and a half in between, I ran into some issues with javascript (see preivous post mentioned above), and there were some things I definitely wish I had done differently since the beginning. 

What I hope this blog post will be for you: 
*  *Helpful* I hope I can share my struggles to help any one else out there avoid them and save some time and frustration.


* *Entertaining* I hope my struggles are as entertaining to you as they were to me. While there were up's and down's through the project, as a coder (working by yourself) sometimes you just have to laugh and smile through the pain. 


* *Inspirational* - The Ruby CLI Gem project intimdated the S--T out of me! Despite the fact that I had put in a ton of time to be prepared and ready to complete it (like many of you reading this may be), I still felt like the project was going to make or BREAK me. SPOILER ALERT - it didn't break me, not even close. In all honesty, it's really not even that bad. I feel like if you go into it with the mindset I have when I'm working out (just survive it and then be proud of that) then you'll be just fine! If you want to kill it and make the best CLI data gem project out there, more power to you! I support you! 


So, here is my advice, given in list form, because I *love* lists. 

**1. Don't Rush! **

I had 5 days till I was leaving for a vacation. I was JUST starting the final project section of the Ruby cirriculum, meaning I still had to do the Tic-Tac-Toe AI lab *and* the student scraper lab. *Yikes!* There was just no way I was going to reach my goal of submitting my CLI project before I left. (ambitious goal alert!) 

So what did I do? I thought, yeah...just skip the other labs and start working on your CLI project...that's a **great** idea. WELL. folks. it wasn't. Why not? 

There are so many resources and people to support you through the process of completing the CLI project, but I knew *none* of it because they had no idea I had skiped forward and started on it. 

When you get to the final project section, it will flag the instructors to send you loads of helpful e-mails, resources, and MOST, MOST, **MOST** importantly an *ideation* form where you pitch your idea and get it approved. 

Basically all the helpful e-mails were answers to the millions of questions I had (since I started my project without said helpful e-mails/resources). It would have saved me time and frustration to just complete the labs in order. 


**2. Ask for  help! **

Yes, it's true, you can't go to our old friend the "Ask Question" box for this project. HOWEVER there still so many people you can go to for help. 

SLACK - In said helpful e-mails (above) you will get the slack channel for the project. Perfect place to post a question if you need some feedback or have a question. You can also post questions to other larger channels - people are SO SO helpful! 

[1-on-1 Project Help](https://theflatironschool.typeform.com/to/B9BrgH) - You can only use this 4 times, but trust me 4 times is more than enough! Use this for the really tough questions, and make sure you post it on slack first! 


**3. It's ok to take breaks. **

Some of the major break throughs I had in places were I was stuck was when I walked away from  my computer. 

[Rubber Ducky it out! ](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) - Talk to a Rubber Ducky, or your dog, or your mirror. Sounds weird but it works. 

Take a walk - I'm lucky to have dogs that actually force me to take a break and go on walks. It helps clear the mind. 

Go to sleep - Maybe it's just me, but sometimes banging your head against the same idea for hours, then waking up the next morning with a lack of sleep isn't the most productive way to solve a problem. Sleep is love. Sleep is life.
