My journey to and through coding started when I was in the 3rd grade. I learned how to script in HTML on my desktop computer - yes, on dial-up - through a site called LisaExplains.com. To add a visual, the site was in bright colors, and written in the font Comic Sans. (NOTE: LisaExplains.com is still online TODAY - here's the link http://www.lissaexplains.com/). Not in comic sans anymore, but still as bright and lively as ever.  At the time I didn't think much of it, I just loved seeing the ideas in my head come to life on my GeoCities web page. I loved designing layouts, then scripting the html I needed to make the layouts come to life on the web. 

Eventually GeoCities started charing heafty fees for hosting webistes and I slowly moved away from scripting web pages from scratch and focused more on meeting my highest priority - having the best Myspace layout. If you had a myspace back in the day you know what I'm talking about (unless you were one of those people who used the stock layouts - *side eye*)

I always had a love of technology. For the 6th grade science fair a built a phone using a kit from the Scholastic Magazine. I loved that thing, despite the fact that the case was made of cardboard and the on/off switch would always fall inside (making it almost impossible to use!). I still used it every time I needed to call someone. 

Growing up I never saw myself as person who had a talent in STEM. I was a young woman of color and there were messages all around me that told me I didn't belong. So, as I got older, I moved further and further away from my passion for technology, STEM, and coding. 


Fast forward to college. After switching my major 10293809234938 times,  I eventually landed on my double major - Math and Physics. Again, there were a lot of obstacles I faced getting to that point as a woman of color (self-doubt, racism, sexism -- another story for another time). I landed a job as a undergraduate researcher, where I would be working on developing and implementing electronics. I had to learn how code on an arudiuno and in Java, and my love of coding came back into the picture. I loved the work I did so much. 

Now, after being a high school STEM teacher, I've decided to reinvest in my passion for coding. My vision is to make quality education more accessible - for all students.
