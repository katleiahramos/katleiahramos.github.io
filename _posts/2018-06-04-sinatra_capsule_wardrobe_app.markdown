## The Context 

You might be wondering, what is a capsule wardrobe? 

Via Wikipedia it is the following 

> Capsule wardrobe is a term coined by Susie Faux, the owner of a London boutique called "Wardrobe" in the 1970s. According to Faux, a capsule wardrobe is a collection of a few essential items of clothing that don't go out of fashion, such as skirts, trousers, and coats, which can then be augmented with seasonal pieces.
> 

Capsule wardrobe is often synonymous with a minimalist wardrobe or parallel to a minimalist closet. 

What is a minimalist wardrobe? Pretty much what it sounds like. Cutting down your closet into a few essential pieces that you really love (your capsule). Your capsule can serve multiple purposes such as:
* Defining your style or your brand. 
* Saving you money by helping you keep track of what you really need and what you really DON'T need (if you're like me and have something like 10 black shirts...) 
* Promoting sustainability in the world of fashion, where so much consumerism revovles around the idea of "fast-fashion" (cheap & quick), which can lead to non-ethical production of clothing.
